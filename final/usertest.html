        <h2>Significant Observations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Need for clearer conext of Project Narrative:</strong> While users enjoyed their tasks, they did not understand the purpose or significance behind them</li>
            <li><strong>Need for feedback when user completes a minigame:</strong> User wanted a 'well donee' or 'congrats' whn they accomplished the task of clearing the red circles</li>
            <li><strong>Need for ability to escape certain 'views' in minigames:</strong> Users ended up stuck in some areeas of the website due to a lack of back button or escape</li>

        <h2>Update Plan</h2>
        <p>I plan to take all these feedbacks into account when coding my game. I first plan to full realize the concept and narrative of the project so that I can better deliver that conteent to my users and help them understand who they are in the story. I then plan to code in places of feedback for when the users carry ou the activites so users can feel ensured their doing things right. Lastly, I plan on making sure the website is sufficiently navigationable so that users to not get stck or lost when on my site.</p>
