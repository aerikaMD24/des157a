    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>A digital spy adventure where you try to find your enemy before they hack the system database too much to your entire agency’s detriment. </p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal for this project is to make a cohesive narrative experience with some mildly interactive gameplay. I would like to create an overall strong interaction that has a similar feel to a visual novel but more immersive and interactive. I also intend to make use of a lot of what I learned from previous projects in this main final project as a culmination of the skills and strategies developed throughout the quarter. Lastly, I simply wish to live out my younger self’s desire to be a super cool super spy, channeling the vibes of Kim Possible and Totally Spies.</p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I want for my users to experience a fun narrative adventure trying to find their enemy. I’m hoping for them to enjoy the mild gameplay in the project as well as the tidbits of lore they may find while exploring around the website. I want to try to make the experience both enjoyable but also challenging so as to not bore users as they get from point A to B. I also hope that the overall project will have some replayabe value and that users would desire to at least replay it once more after their first run through of it. </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>I plan to use a similar aesthetic to my MadLibs, using a lot of blues and whites as well as monospaced type to create that ‘techy feel’. I also plan to experiment with sound a lot for this project in order to bring the experience to life and make the user feel as if they were in a spy movie. (e.g. camera zoom sounds, typing sounds, beeps) I also intend to potentially make use of the typing effect throughout the project to enhance the feeling of this spy database. In contrast to the MadLibs project, I’m considering adding the contrasting color of red to potentially represent the new enemy figure which acts as the main conflict to the user. </p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>The main interaction strategies I have for this project would be through the ‘minigames’ that the user has to accomplish in order to ‘defeat’ the enemy. Right now I have plans for 3 minigames (a clicking-based one, a zoom-based one and an input-based one) and will prioritize according to time constraints. The one I’m prioritizing would be the zoom-based on which will have users interact with a giant picture under the guise of a cctv camera and allows users to ‘zoom in’ on suspicious persons to try and identify who their enemy is. I plan to use a camera-based UI to give users visual feedback when clicking on places to zoom.</p>
