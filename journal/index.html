        <h2>Form Design</h2>

            This was a <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">very interesting article</a> as I’ve never really given much thought to form designs before. The part about key tabbing was especially fascinating to me, I was not aware of it at all but it’s definitely a good thing to keep in mind to make forms as accessible as possible. The cons of placeholder text was also very interesting to me, while the more aesthetic choice, I can see how it can possibly do more harm than good for the reader so it’ll definitely be something I keep in mind when I do my project.

            I’d recently applied for my <a href="https://www.saclibrary.org/My-Library-Card/Get-a-Library-Card/Library-Card-Applications-Adults">local library card</a> and I really liked how simple and straightforward the whole process was. It used a 1-column layout, the labels were generally found on the top of each input field and required questions were clearly marked. Something that I particularly enjoyed was how they highlighted the focus fields with a nice lime green color that matched the palette for the rest of their website. It was a simple but nice way to really tie everything together. (Also, a quick PSA to get your local library card if you haven’t already!)
