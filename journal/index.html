        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-02-09">09 Feb 2023</time>
        <p>
            I felt that the exercise in the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">Visual Thinking article</a> was very useful. I think in today’s day and age, where loads and loads of information is essentially spoonfed to you (sometimes in overwhelming amounts), it’s nice to have something not so straightforward. To have filled out the details yourself. Being able to figure things out on your own is an important skill. Cause unlike the internet, in real life we’re often presented with ambiguous or unclear stimuli and we’re not always going to have a caption.

            Unfortunately in the real world there’s not going to be text explaining to you why you should buy one car fuel over the other. On the internet however… Meet the <a href="https://www.prometheusfuels.com/">visual novel/game-like website by Prometheus Fuel</a> where you scroll down the page to get a smooth animation of your car on a riveting journey. Sway your mouse from side-to-side to tilt your camera view and use the spacebar to accelerate your car and energize molecules. While it’s all just a way to advertise their fuel, it’s definitely an experience you won’t regret!

        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-02-07">07 Feb 2023</time>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">The article</a> raised some really interesting points. I thought that the question of whether an overlay is actually needed or whether another page is needed instead was very eye-opening. I think nowadays with how commonplace overlays are, it’s very easy to forget the main purpose or benefits to it in the first place. First and foremost, overlays should be quick and easy to digest. Stuff like inner scrolling or having heaves and heaves of content within it essentially defeats the purpose. And like I mentioned before, begs the question of why not have another page instead?
        </p>

            The part about trying to align a website owner’s goals with the user’s goals also stood out to me. How many times have we been annoyed by another ‘Subscribe to xxx!’ pop-up? But if that sense of urgency is triggered in both parties, well then the annoyance evoked is greatly minimized. And minimizing user annoyances is exactly the game we’re playing when making a website. Cause in the end, a happy user is a returning user.

        <h2>Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-01-31">31 Jan 2023</time>
        <p>
            This was a <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">very interesting article</a> as I’ve never really given much thought to form designs before. The part about key tabbing was especially fascinating to me, I was not aware of it at all but it’s definitely a good thing to keep in mind to make forms as accessible as possible. The cons of placeholder text was also very interesting to me, while the more aesthetic choice, I can see how it can possibly do more harm than good for the reader so it’ll definitely be something I keep in mind when I do my project.

            I’d recently applied for my <a href="https://www.saclibrary.org/My-Library-Card/Get-a-Library-Card/Library-Card-Applications-Adults">local library card</a> and I really liked how simple and straightforward the whole process was. It used a 1-column layout, the labels were generally found on the top of each input field and required questions were clearly marked. Something that I particularly enjoyed was how they highlighted the focus fields with a nice lime green color that matched the palette for the rest of their website. It was a simple but nice way to really tie everything together. (Also, a quick PSA to get your local library card if you haven’t already!)
